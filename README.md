# Custom Semaphore

## Final Project Template Files

### DESCRIPTION
Simple program that solves the sleeping barber problem. 
The program is not complete and you'll need to complete mysem.c to implement semaphore.

### PERIPHERALS USED
This example exercises the following peripherals:
- STDOUT device (UART or JTAG UART)

### SOFTWARE SOURCE FILES
This example includes the following software source files:
- hello_world.c: Everyone needs a Hello World program, right?

### BOARD/HOST REQUIREMENTS
This example requires only a JTAG connection with a Nios Development board. If
the host communication settings are changed from JTAG UART (default) to use a
conventional UART, a serial cable between board DB-9 connector  and the host is
required.
